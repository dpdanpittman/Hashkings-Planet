## Support
Creating a blockchain game takes a lot of time. Unlike others frameworks,
Hashkings is completely independently funded. This does mean
however that we also have to spend time working contracts to pay the bills.
This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent
improving Hashkings rather than dealing with distractions.
